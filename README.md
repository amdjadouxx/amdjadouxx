# Facial Recognition with Supervised Learning

This project implements facial recognition using various supervised learning algorithms. The goal is to classify images as either "Arnie" or "Non-Arnie".

## Project Structure

- `main.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the code for data loading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `data/`: Directory containing the dataset `lfw_arnie_nonarnie.csv`.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- seaborn
- matplotlib
